Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I'm not sure I fully understand the question but well the timer suprised me, it wasn't always faster to run less simulations,
I guess the difference between 10 and 100 is nothing to a computer.
Besides that I was a little bit suprised to see the lower rated teams to have such a small chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

From what I saw I feel like 1000 simulations is actually quite accurate.
So depending on my bar I'd say somewhere between 1k and 10k simulations.
