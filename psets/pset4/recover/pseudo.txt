open a new jpeg file
write 512 bytes until a new jpeg is found
stop at end of file

FILE *f fopen(filename, "r");

fread(data, size (BYTE), number (512), inptr)

use buffer (array of bytes)

buffer[0] 0xff
buffer[1] 0xd8
buffer[2] 0xff
(buffer[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0

making a new jpeg

filenames: ###.jpg, starting at 000.jpg

need counter to keep track of jpgs, for to know what to name them

to name files use

sprintf(filename, "03i.jpg", 2;) (2 means file will be names 002.jpg)

FILE *img = fopen(filename, "w");

fwrite(data, size, number, outptr);

data: pointer to bytes that will be written to file
size: size of each element to write
number: number of elements to write
outptr: FILE * to write to

fread(data, size, number, inptr)

data: pointer to where to store data you're reading
size: size of each element to read
number: number of elements to read
inptr: FILE * to read from

fread returns number of items of size (size) that were read

use this to write a condition that determines if fread has gotten to the end of the file */
